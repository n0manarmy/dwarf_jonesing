# About
Things that need to be created, adjusted, tweaked. The numbers correspond to the scene as well as the original map.

# TODO First
Theme discussion. I've been framing this around Jones in the Fast lane but am using ascii dwarf graphics. I think the theme should be based on the ascii graphics/rogue-lite/dwarf content.

# General
* Some sort of Clock to use a graphic to show the players time. Will build logic to fill the clock as the turn time fills up.
* Any sort of styling of buttons
